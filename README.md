## Hi there 👋
- This is Seyed Miaad Nabizadeh, but you can call me simply Miaad.
- Welcome to my GitHub! I’m a data-driven marketing analyst with a knack for turning data into actionable insights and creative solutions to real-world problems.

## 💻 What I work with:

- Languages & Tools: SQL, Python, R, Power BI, and always exploring new technologies.
- Interests: Building models, analyzing datasets, and collaborating on innovative projects.
## 🌟 A little about me:
- When I’m not deep in code or crunching numbers, you can find me enjoying coffee, indulging in pizza, or reflecting on the journey of learning itself. I believe in embracing ambiguity and finding common ground to tackle challenges together.

## 🤝 Let’s connect, collaborate, and create something meaningful. Cheers! ☕🍕
